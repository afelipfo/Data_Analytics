This client owns a few restaurants in their hometown.  They have collected and maintained various data sources in Excel Spreadsheets and they have come to you for help making sense of it.  They arenâ€™t certain which pieces of information are relevant so itâ€™s up to you to distill the information into a useful set of analytic reports.  The reports will be presented to the customer at a future meeting.\n","\n","## Background\n","\n","The purpose of this exercise is to see what you glean from the information and how you present the information in Tableau dashboards.  You are welcome to use any additional data sources that you find relevant.  You are also able to use any additional tools such as Tableau Prep, Python, Alteryx, R, etc. to reshape or modify your data.\n","\n","## Expectations\n","\n","We would like to get an understanding of your process when asked to analyze data for Tableau Workbooks.  \n","Please document the following to be shared during your presentation:\n","\n","\n","*   Any assumptions youâ€™ve made regarding the data and its completeness or lack thereof\n","*   Any modifications to the data youâ€™ve made and how you went about making the decision to modify the data\n","*  Any additional tools you utilized to complete the work sample\n","\n","## Files\n","\n","We have included 4 comma separated values (csv) files for you to analyze.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n","\n","This will help us to understand the basic structure and characteristics of the data.\n","For this, I started making a \"Data Dictionary\" of the meaning of every variable in all the datasets: [Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UfITEfaF4legsCSNm81Gj2B3z1F8n8Rr7jy_N2ukiGc/edit?usp=drive_link)\n","\n","How will I do this?\n","\n","- I will use EDA in each dataset per separate\n","  - For what?

Insights and interpretation\n","\n","### What kind of insights can we conclude from our EDA:\n","\n","- Interpret the impact of each variable.\n","- Identify significant trends in sales and patterns on demographics behavior.\n","- Display the most important insights and connect them with our objectives.\n","\n","Here we extract actionable insights from what we understood in EDA and we can answer the questions:\n","\n","- There are only 3 relevant datasets: Product sales, Demographics and Daypart.\n","- The Weather dataset does not provide valuable information to our analytics model, because all the stores are distribuited in the same state but different area. So, we should not expect a significatively high variation in the weather.\n","- Concerning about making a multivariate analysis, our datasets have different units of analysis (in terms of time and store level), so making these comparison would result pretty complex. Also, there is not a lot of information at all in our datasets to lets us make distributions.\n","- The multivariate analysis we have done here, starts from making univariate analysis, including the descriptive table corresponding to demographics matrix, which can highlight in someway about what we see from the univariates analyses.\n","\n","- What are the sales trends over time?\n","  - Total sales displayed a weekly seasonal pattern, with a stationary trend in the days 6, 14 and 20. We can observe a sales peak at day 28. We can check the calendar to see the days: [Calendar 2011](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterstock.com%2Fes%2Fsearch%2Fcalendar-2011&psig=AOvVaw3Loh1MP4Mwv_awz0NCiAF4&ust=1717170177219000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCLDcrcTbtYYDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)\n","  - Looking per each store, we observed that the behavior of Store 1, Store3 and Store4 showed a quite similar pattern along the month. However, Store4 showed the higher variability, as it showed the higher and lower peaks compared with other stores.\n","  - Now, evaluating the behavior per days in the business, we observed the Mondays showed the higher value of total units sold and the Tuesdays showed the lower value of total units sold.\n","  - We observe that in general, the sales are provided by Regular menus, as there was observed few sales by combos, and can't state that the sales are significatively dependant on combos release.\n","\n","- How do demographics influence sales?\n","  - We observed an interesting distribution between the african, hispanic and asian variables which represent the percentage of asian consumer presence. It can be seen that Store (the store with the highest sales) showed a higher presence of asian consumers and a bit higher afroamerican consumers compared to other stores.\n","  - We can see from the demographics dataset that our geographical region is the Northwest Region of USA.\n","\n","    Some additional information about this region and these :\n","\n","    [Northwest Territorial Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territorial_Imperative)\n","  - There is an interesting pattern in demographics dataset, showing that afroamericans and asiatic population, could have some effect on Store 2! We can see from the demographics matrix that there is an insightful information related to Store2 concerning to demographics aspects. Which can help us to think in some way about some population characteristics concerning to household habits (would be thought that people does not have constant interaction with their families), urban demographic segment distributions (like there is any suburb or geographical segmenmt with only one racial population, e.g. a chinese town), people with enough job or incomes who can afford to go to consume a lot (and show a trend over time). Also, it showed in someway these consumers belong to an intermedium class, they are young aged (25 - 35) years old, and who like to go out to make some kind of leisure.\n","\n","- What is the impact of different times of the day (dayparts) on sales?\n","  - We observed a pretty interesting pattern when comparing the sales distribution across different dayparts for all the stores. Specifically, Store2 showed the peak on sales, also the highest mean value in the fringe concerning to breakfast, morning and lunch!\n","  - Ater the lunch, it was seen that the behavior totally changed, because in the afternoon and evening it showed more variance in Store2.\n","  - All stores show the lowest sales during the Late Night period, with minimal sales, highlighting a consistent pattern across all stores.\n","  - Significant outliers are present in the Afternoon and Evening parts for all stores, suggesting these times are less predictable in sales performance.\n","  - There is a high correlation between value of sales and quantity of transactions, which can help us to understand that the higher the sales quantity, the higher the profit will be.\n","  - Insights for operation:\n","    - We can suggest to offer more combo products, including exotical menus which can be attractive but can be a bit more expensive.\n","    - We can try to optimize the menu in someway, analyzing which are the most interesting menus, which give us more profitable gain and make promos of these ones.\n","    - We can conclude that Regular Menu period is the most profitable and consistent across all stores.\n","    - Late Night is the least profitable period, indicating potential areas for operational adjustments or marketing focus.\n","    - Afternoon and Evening showed high variability, pointing towards the need for targeted strategies to stabilize sales during these times.\n","    - We can try to implement a marketing campaign focused on the other stores, specially Store3 which showed the lower incomes compared to others. In this store, we can see a high presence of hispanic population, so we can try to customize the experience according to their interest.\n","    - More data would be useful to make these strategies, specifically detailed information about menus offered, time spent by customers in the store and a detailed analysis about the \"combos\" which can be a strength in our model\n","\n","- How does weather affect sales?\n","  - The weather dataset does not offer valuable insights for our analysis as it covers the same geographical scale, preventing distinctions between subregions relevant to each store. Additionally, it compares weather models from 2010 and 2011, which predict weather accuracy based on variables beyond our project's scope. Despite interesting variability due to natural factors, the data does not allow us to assess weather's impact on consumer behavior.\n","  - We can see some information here:\n","\n","    [THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO WEATHER FORECAST MODELS IN 2024](https://climavision.com/resources/the-ultimate-guide-to-weather-forecast-models/)\n","\n","\n","## 5. How could we apply a more advanced model here?\n","\n","We noticed in our data that there are no inputs for developing a predictive model directly here. However, in the weather dataset, there was observed an interesting pattern which could be evaluated through some unsupervised machine learning model, taking into account the variabilitry observed in the both models, specially that the Last Year (LY_MODEL) showed a better performance in general, however, the current year model showed a high difference between peaks and even there was an outlier far from the \"normal\" predictions. So, we could possibly apply a predictive model using more data related to historical behavior comparing these two models and taking into account the another variables observed through the correlation map.\n","\n","## 6.
